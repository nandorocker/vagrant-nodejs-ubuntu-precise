Vagrant: Node.js
================

* Based on Ubuntu 12.04 (precise64)
* Installs via shell script:
	* Basic system tools (git, vim, make, Python, G++ compiler)
	* Node.js (from Chris Lea's repo for 12.04)
	* MongoDB
	
This is my first stab at a setup script for Node.js. I am not a professional developer, so if you know a better way to do anything I've done here, feel free to send your constructive feedback! :)
